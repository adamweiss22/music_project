Logistic Regression Model created to help me find more Rap and Hip-Hop songs that I will like.

I love music but am terrible at finding new songs/artists that I like without my friends showing 
me. I played around with a logistic regression model created using some functions imported by the 
sklearn package. This model was created in .py file and I manipulated my data and fed it into this 
program in the provided notebook file. My data was found online from a public repository. I used 
only rap and Hip-Hop songs from this dataset because my dad can't suggest new songs for these 
genres like he does for classic rock. The dataset contains 10,000 Rap and Hip-Hop songs with many
descriptive features about each song. After feeding the model a few songs that I do and don't like,
it predicted that I would like 5,573 of the 10,000 songs. I also used the predict_proba feature
to sort the songs that the model is most confident I will like. I will start listening to these and
see how accurate my model is. I hope you enjoy!
